## ðŸ’¡ Useful Informations
1. Due to the limitations of Heroku's free account, microservices stop automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity, so it's necessary to run each one manually (by accessing the URL) for them to work correctly<br>
2. The systems use an environment variable to connect to the database. It is necessary to set the variable MONGODB_DEV_URL with the MongoDB acess URL.<br>
